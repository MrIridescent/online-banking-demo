# Unconventional Cover Letter — A Digital Polymath in Service

Last Updated: 2026-02-19

To whom it may concern,

I write not only to request a role, but to offer a practical alliance: give me difficult technical problems, and I will return systems that are secure, understandable, and measurable.

My name is David Akpoviroro Oke, also known as MrIridescent. I have written code since August 2004 and I continue to evolve across software engineering, cybersecurity, AI systems, digital design, and technical operations.

I am applying with the spirit of a builder: if selected, I will demonstrate capability through direct delivery.

## What I Can Deliver

1. Engineering systems that move from idea to production without losing clarity.
2. Cybersecurity-first design, including threat-informed controls and defensive depth.
3. Purple-team perspective that connects attacker mindset with blue-team resilience.
4. AI-informed implementation grounded in practical architecture, not hype.
5. Clean documentation and operational runbooks that help teams execute consistently.

## Technical and Creative Breadth

- Web and mobile development
- A+ and N+ foundational computing/network understanding
- Ethical hacking and cyber-threat management
- Endpoint security engineering and operational hardening
- Graphic design and motion graphics
- Video shooting, editing, and cinematography-driven storytelling

## Work Philosophy

I care about outcomes. I reduce ambiguity. I build systems that people can use and teams can maintain.

Where others stop at demos, I prefer implementation details, controls, and operational readiness.

## Why I Am Seeking This Opportunity

I am pursuing a role where I can be challenged, trusted, and measured by impact.

I want to contribute deeply, learn continuously, and remain lifelong employable by solving real technical problems at high standards.

If there is an opportunity to prove my value directly—through practical tasks, architecture exercises, secure code delivery, or production-readiness execution—I am ready.

Respectfully,

David Akpoviroro Oke  
MrIridescent (The Creative Renaissance Man)
